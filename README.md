### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nicolas Garcia, an enthusiast software engineer based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

ðŸŒŸ About Me
Originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina, I moved to Amsterdam three years ago and fell in love with the country and lifestyle. I enjoy exploring new technologies and developing data-driven solutions to complex problems. My background is in software engineering, and I'm passionate about building scalable, efficient, and reliable systems.
