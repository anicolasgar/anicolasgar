### Hi there, I'm Nicolas Garcia ðŸ‘‹

I was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina, but I've been living in Amsterdam for pretty much three years now & enjoying every second of it!
The Netherlands has won over my heart, I fell in love with the country and lifestyle. Getting around everywhere by bike is something... amazing :heart_eyes: Also, the cultural diversity you can find here is unique.
